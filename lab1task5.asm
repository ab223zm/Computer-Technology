; Lab number: 1
; Title: How to use the PORTs. Digital input/output. Subroutine call.
;
; Hardware: STK600, CPU ATmega2560
;
; Function: Creating a Ring Counter, that will light up each LED at
; a time, while turning the previous one off.
;
; Input ports: None.
; 
; Output ports: On-board LEDs connected to PORTB.
;
; Subroutines: Delay of approximately 0,5 sec in between each count.
; Included files: m2560def.inc
;
; Other information: None.
;
; Changes in program: None.
